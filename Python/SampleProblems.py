# You're given a list of (category, points) pairs. A student may pick up to three books, but no two can be from the same category. 
# The goal is to choose the combination that yields the highest total points.

# [("Math", 10), ("Science", 8), ("History", 7), ("Math", 6)]
# Best choice: Math(10) + Science(8) + History(7) = 25

# [("Fiction", 5), ("Fiction", 9), ("Art", 4)]
# Best choice: Fiction(9) + Art(4) = 13
